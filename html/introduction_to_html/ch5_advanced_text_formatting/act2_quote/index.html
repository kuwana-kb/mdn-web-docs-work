    <h1>Quotation Example</h1>
    <p>Hello and welcome to my motivation page. As <a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/c/confucius.html"><cite>Confucius</cite></a> once said:</p>
    <p><blockquote cite="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/c/confucius.html">It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.</blockquote></p>
    <p>I also love the concept of positive thinking, and The Need To Eliminate Negative Self Talk (as mentioned in <a href="http://www.affirmationsforpositivethinking.com/index.htm"><cite>Affirmations for Positive Thinking.)</cite></a></p>
